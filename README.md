# Discode

Discord web platform, made to look like an IDE so you can chat with your friends at your typical dev job.

## This is an open-source project

If you can, want, and have time to help, feel free to do so. I suck at coding, I suck even more at designing, and I suck
the most at staying focused on one project.

## Made with passion to prevent you from being productive
